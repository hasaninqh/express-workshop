     One of the first Directors of the House of Wisdom in Bagdad in the early 9th Century was an outstanding Persian mathematician called Muhammad Al-Khwarizmi. He oversaw the translation of the major Greek and Indian mathematical and astronomy works <em>(including those of Brahmagupta)</em> into Arabic, and produced original work which had a lasting influence on the advance of Muslim and <em>(after his works spread to Europe through Latin translations in the 12th Century)</em> later European mathematics.

     Al-Khwārizmī accomplished most of his work in the period between 813 and 833. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, Baghdad <mark>(<strong>the recent capital of what is known today as Iraq</strong>)</mark> became the centre of scientific studies and trade, and many merchants and scientists from as far as China and India traveled to this city, as did al-Khwārizmī. He worked in Baghdad as a scholar at the House of Wisdom established by Caliph al-Ma’mūn, where he studied the sciences and mathematics, which included the translation of Greek and Sanskrit scientific manuscripts.

The word “algorithm” is derived from the Latinization of his name, and the word <strong>"algebra"</strong> is derived from the Latinization of <strong>"al-jabr"</strong>, part of the title of his most famous book, in which he introduced the fundamental algebraic methods and techniques for solving equations.

         Perhaps his most important contribution to mathematics was his strong advocacy of the Hindu numerical system, which Al-Khwarizmi recognized as having the power and efficiency needed to revolutionize Islamic and Western mathematics. The Hindu numerals 1 - 9 and 0 - which have since become known as Hindu-Arabic numerals - were soon adopted by the entire Islamic world. Later, with translations of Al-Khwarizmi’s work into Latin by Adelard of Bath and others in the 12th Century, and with the influence of Fibonacci’s <em>“Liber Abaci”</em> they would be adopted throughout Europe as well.
